Table of Content

Do you know that almost

55%

of healthcare processes will adopt blockchain by 2025? Do you wonder why blockchain in healthcare is becoming so popular?

If you were thinking about integrating blockchain into your healthcare app but were in doubt, we are here to clear it!

In this blog, we will discuss what blockchain technology is, its use cases, and the benefits of blockchain in healthcare. We'll also highlight companies using blockchain in healthcare. This will give you a glimpse of blockchain's transformative power.

What is Blockchain Technology

Blockchain technology is a way to keep track of information in a secure and transparent way. It works by creating a growing list of records called blocks.

These blocks are linked together and secured using cryptography. Each block contains a timestamp and a link to the previous block. That makes it difficult to change or tamper with the information.

Here's how it works

Transaction:

A transaction (like sending money, updating a record, or creating a digital asset) occurs.

Verification:

This transaction is verified by multiple computers on the network (nodes).

Block Creation:

Once verified, the transaction is added to a block along with other verified transactions.

Chaining:

The block is linked to the previous block in the chain, creating a chronological order.

Decentralization:

Copies of this blockchain are distributed across multiple computers, ensuring no single entity controls the information.

9 Use Cases of Blockchain in Healthcare

Blockchain technology is often associated with cryptocurrencies, but its potential goes far beyond financial applications. One industry that stands to benefit immensely from blockchain is healthcare.

From securing patient data to improving the efficiency of medical supply chains, blockchain offers a variety of solutions to some of the most pressing challenges in the field.

Curious how this technology could transform healthcare? Let’s explore 9 key use cases where blockchain is making a real impact.

1 - Electronic Health Records (EHRs)

Healthcare data is often vulnerable to security breaches, errors, and lacks patient control.

Blockchain offers a solution to these problems. It distributes patient data across a network of computers instead of a central database. That makes it much harder for hackers to access or change records. Blockchain also tracks and verifies every change to medical records.

This ensures the information is always accurate and up to date. This means doctors and nurses have the latest information to make the best decisions about patient care.

2 - Clinical Trials

Keeping data accurate and getting proper permission from patients are all big challenges when conducting clinical trials. These issues can make research take longer and even raise questions about the trustworthiness of the results.

Blockchain technology creates a secure, permanent record for patient information in clinical trials. This ensures data accuracy and prevents tampering, addressing key challenges in research. This ensures the accuracy of the data. It also makes it easier for researchers to identify trends and make reliable discoveries.

Blockchain can manage the patient consent process in clinical trials. This ensures they are fully informed about potential risks and benefits before deciding to participate. This makes clinical trials more ethical and trustworthy.

3 - Claims Processing and Billing

The current claims and billing process in healthcare can be complex, time-consuming, and prone to errors. This leads to delays and increases administrative costs.

Blockchain has the potential to automate and simplify this process by creating a shared, immutable ledger of claims and payments. This can reduce administrative costs and improve the speed and accuracy of payments to healthcare providers.

4 - Supply Chain Management

Counterfeit drugs and lack of transparency in the pharmaceutical supply chain pose significant risks to patient safety.

Blockchain can be used to track the movement of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies from the manufacturer to the patient. This creates a transparent and secure record that helps prevent counterfeit drugs from entering the supply chain.

Also, blockchain can

improve supply chain efficiency

by automating inventory management and tracking the real-time status of shipments.

5 - Identity Management

Healthcare providers constantly grapple with safeguarding patient data and preventing fraud. A key aspect of this challenge is ensuring the secure and reliable identification of all parties involved.

Blockchain can create unique digital identities for patients and healthcare providers. That will make it easier to verify their identity and authorize access to medical records. This can help prevent identity theft and protect patient privacy.

6 - Appointment Scheduling

Traditional appointment scheduling systems are often prone to errors, double bookings, and no-shows. This leads to inefficiencies and frustrated patients.

Blockchain technology can be used to create a secure and tamper-proof system for appointment scheduling. Patients can book appointments online, and their information is stored on the blockchain, which can only be accessed by authorized parties. This ensures that appointments are not double-booked and that patient data is secure.

7 - Telemedicine

Telemedicine is becoming more common, which means we need strong solutions. These solutions must protect patient privacy and manage the increasing amount of medical data from virtual visits.

During a telemedicine appointment, the doctor might collect information about the symptoms or medical history of the patient. Blockchain can create a secure and private record of this information, making sure it's protected.

Additionally, the secure communication channels of blockchain can ensure privacy during video calls or messages with the doctor.

8 - Permissioned Access Control

Patients often have limited control over who can access their medical data, and data breaches can compromise patient privacy.

Blockchain allows patients to have greater control over their medical data. They can grant or deny access to specific healthcare providers or researchers. That ensures that their information is only shared with authorized individuals.

9 - Medication Adherence

Non-adherence to medication regimens is a major problem that can negatively impact patient outcomes and increase healthcare costs.

By securely recording when medications are prescribed, dispensed, and taken, blockchain can help monitor whether patients are following their treatment plans as directed. This can help healthcare providers identify patients who may need additional support and ultimately improve health outcomes.

If you want to implement blockchain solutions in your healthcare projects, you can

hire certified Blockchain developers

to ensure the successful integration of blockchain technology.

Top 5 Benefits of Blockchain in Healthcare

Now that we know how blockchain technology works, let’s look at its benefits.

1 - Enhanced Security for Sensitive Data

Keeping patient information safe and private is important. Blockchain technology helps with this in two ways:

It spreads information across many computers. That makes it very difficult for hackers to steal data.

It uses strong security measures to keep medical records safe from changes or tampering.

This helps protect your personal health information so that only authorized people can see it. This is one of the most important benefits of blockchain in healthcare.

2 - Improved Data Sharing and Collaboration

Blockchain technology helps doctors and hospitals share patient records safely and easily. This means everyone involved in the care of the patient can quickly get the right information. That helps them make the best decisions for the patient. This also ensures they get the best possible treatment.

3 - Transparency and Trust

Blockchain technology creates a permanent record of all medical transactions and data exchanges. This ensures everyone is held accountable, and all participants can confirm the accuracy and reliability of the medical information.

With blockchain, patients, doctors, and everyone involved can be confident that they are working with trustworthy data.

4 - Patient Empowerment and Control

Blockchain gives patients more control over their health data than ever before. Patients have full control over who can see their medical records and can easily grant or revoke access.

This ensures privacy while allowing them to participate in research or share information with trusted providers. This empowers individuals to take a more active role in their healthcare decisions.

5 - Streamlining Supply Chain for Safer Medications

Blockchain technology enables a secure and transparent tracking system for pharmaceuticals and medical supplies. This means each step in the journey, from manufacturing to reaching the patient, is recorded and cannot be tampered with.

As a result, counterfeit medications are much harder to slip into the system, keeping patients safer. This streamlined supply chain management also helps healthcare providers cut costs and operate more efficiently.
