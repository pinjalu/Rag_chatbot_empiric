90% of Fortune 500 companies

go for outsourcing, and the industry is expected to grow at about 4% CAGR. A dedicated development team of Professionals will work tirelessly on your project, supplementing your in-house staff.

59% of companies

outsource to cut costs.

So, hiring dedicated developers who have the capacity to expand resources according to project needs, along with their long-term commitment and flexibility, makes them ideal partners for clients.

What is a Dedicated Development Team and Its Role?

A dedicated development team is a group of IT specialists (developers, designers, project managers, QA testers) who work on a project for a long or focused period to achieve the main objectives of that project.

The role of a dedicated development team is usually to work with a company towards specific goals and targets. They engage in numerous activities such as mobile app development, software product development, cloud solutions, and many more.

Dedicated Development Team vs. Fixed Price Model

Think about all the things that might affect the success of your project before you choose the engagement model. Several important selection criteria, including cost, quality, flexibility, and time management, will be considered when we evaluate the two methods here.

Dedicated Development Team

Highly flexible, adapting to changing needs and markets.

Higher upfront costs, but cost-effective in the long run.

High-quality, custom work due to continuous involvement.

Flexible with timelines, great for complex projects.

Easily scalable based on project needs.

Risk is shared between client and provider.

Continuous control over IP throughout the project.

Fixed Price Model

Limited scope, changes may extend the timeline or cost.

Defined budget, ideal for fixed-scope projects.

Quality may vary, as the focus is on timeline and budget.

Strict timelines are ideal for short-term.

Limited client involvement, with updates based on initial requirements.

Limited scalability, requiring re-negotiation for changes.

The provider manages risk, but it may shift back to the client with changes.

Ownership transfers at project completion.

So, from the above explanations, we can consider that hiring dedicated developers offers several advantages over the fixed-price model, especially for long-term & complex projects. With a dedicated team, businesses can adjust the team size, project scope, and timelines based on evolving needs, which is crucial in dynamic markets. This model allows for higher quality output as the team is deeply involved, gaining a thorough understanding of the project and leading to a more customized and reliable product.

Things to Consider Before Hiring a Dedicated Development Team

Project Scope

Firstly, establish and detail all the prerequisites and characteristics of your project before searching for a group of individuals to work with.

Budget

Ensure your total budget before hiring a team for a longer duration, as costs are ongoing.

Skill Requirements

Seek a team that has worked with the particular programming language or technology required by your project. This is in addition to the fact that different skills can bring new ideas on board.

Communicative Fit

Look for a team that understands your communication style and way of working. Assess how proficient the members are in expressing their thoughts and how they share information.

Team composition

Ensure the dedicated team you hire has individuals with varied responsibilities, such as software developers, designers, project managers, and quality assurances.

Speed of delivery

Ensure the beneficial turnaround time of the product before finalizing a dedicated team.

Structure of a Dedicated Development Team

The type and complexity of your product, timeline, and the allocated budget determine the structure of a dedicated development team for hire. A typical dedicated development team must include the following roles:

Project Manager

A project manager is the prime person responsible for the day-to-day management of the project.

Business analysts

They look after the business goals and values that bridge between the business and technical teams. They are instrumental in planning development activities and validating requirements to ensure alignment with business goals.

Software developers

A dedicated backend development team should be in charge of building and maintaining the inner mechanisms of your software. Frontend developers are mainly concerned with developing user-interacting parts and mobile apps to make the software more simplified.

Software architect

Moderates the technical details of a project and simultaneously carries out strategic-level planning. They choose the technology stack and make sure the solution you get is workable and optimized.

QA Engineers

Quality assurance engineers undertake full responsibility for all the different parts of your software, be it code or any designs to make sure it achieves the standard.

DevOps Engineers

DevOps engineers look after the development, testing, and automation processes. They facilitate continuous integration, deployment and enable interaction between the dev and ops teams during development for shorter development times and better quality.

Benefits of Hiring a Dedicated Development Team

Full Control

When you

, such collaborations are characterized by more control and clarity. Implementation of tools like Jira and Trello, etc. helps in project management and helps dedicated development teams to keep track of each member in terms of progress and performance.

Flexibility

You can change the number of people working on the project, including their roles, scope of work, and timelines to align with your business objectives.

Cost-Effectiveness

Working with a dedicated team of developers will definitely help to maximize cost-effectiveness, as you will be charged only for the available development resources. In addition, the presence of experienced individuals means that the turnaround for development works is fast, accurate, and free from wastage in terms of time.

Focused Expertise

When you are engaging dedicated developers, you are not limited to the borders of your country. By extending the geographical scope, the chances of finding specialists who understand modern technologies, development processes, and relevant industries improve significantly. This is certainly a good developmental step towards developing a quality service.

Long-term Collaboration

Dedicated teams work on your project consistently, ensuring deep understanding and seamless development.

Steps to Hire a Dedicated Development Team

Define Requirements

Outline the project's scope, goals, and required skills. Thus the first step should be to dedicate some resources to your project documentation before contacting developers. You must do your best to compress it by indicating the basic needs in the development procedure.

Place of recruitment

With the introduction of remote work, outsourcing is less expensive and has a greater time zone overlap. So, now you can choose a developing team from any country with your required expertise.

Listing of Prospective Teams

A search for the local dedicated development team in online directories, review sites, or search engines should begin. You may also ask for referrals or attend trade shows to assess possible technology partners. Based on your search results, create a list of teams that have passed the initial vetting process.

Focus on working Procedure

Contact the shortlisted dedicated developers to obtain further information on their approach to project development, their methods of communication, and their project management systems. Assess Skills and make sure they verify with evidence by checking out their works as well as reviews by other clients.

Find out how their market reviews

Last but not least, you will also need to evaluate the market attitude and image of the hiring dedicated development team in question by reviewing how active they are on social media, comments from former clients, and their overall score on sources such as Clutch and Goodfirms which are specific to that industry.

Cost of Hiring a Dedicated Development Team

Hiring costs for a dedicated development team is pretty variable. It depends on how much each staff member is being paid to the percentage that the provider adds to cover any overhead costs. The cost will run between $5,000 and $25,000 per month, depending on the country where the dedicated team is located.

When Do You Need to Hire a Dedicated Development Team?

For Startups in the Developing Phase

In cases where you are developing quickly and wish to construct offices or structures as quickly as possible, employing a specialized team comes in handy.

Projects with Non-Specific Aims

If a project requires a learning period, the special model allows coping with more tests and studies for a longer period that would otherwise be too expensive.

Projects with a Longer Time Frame

Best suited for expansive undertakings in need of development, most especially due to the need for operational hiring cost savings and use of a foreign labor pool.
