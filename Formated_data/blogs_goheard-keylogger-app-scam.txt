## Understanding the Goheard Scam in Simple Terms

'Goheard' is a website that claims to be useful for meetings, calls, and chats with AI-based translator apps. But, many online security platforms have marked it as a possible scam. The trust scores of the goheard.io and goheard.us sites are very low, which means there could be a risk. So, be careful when dealing with these sites. Here is the [result of the Scamadviser site for the goheard.io site](https://www.scamadviser.com/check-website/goheard.io).

## How Does This Scam Work?

The scam usually starts with an email from what looks like a trustworthy company. The email is well-written and convincing, making many people believe it's real.

This email includes a link to the 'Goheard' app. When you download this app, it doesn't seem to do anything, but it actually works as a keylogger.

A keylogger is a kind of software that records what you type (also, capable of taking screenshots, URL of the page & many more), which could include sensitive information like passwords and credit card numbers.

## How We Found This Might a Scam

They posted a job in the marketplace apps, invited us and many others. We accepted their invitation and started chatting with them. They asked to have a call for further discussion, so we shared a Zoom link. They agreed to join, but when we shared the link, they showed an edited screenshot (as shown below) saying they had trouble joining the Zoom meeting.

We then suggested connecting via Google Meet, but they refused, saying they couldn't join us on Google Meet for security reasons. Then they sent a link to the Goheard website and asked us to have a call through this app. Now we feel this is something unusual so we follow the following steps to check whether the site is genuine or not.

## How Can You Protect Yourself?

### Be careful with unexpected emails

If you get an email from an unknown person or even from someone you know but with a strange request, be suspicious.

### Don't download unfamiliar apps

If an email or message asks you to download an app from a provided link, it's better to avoid it. Only download apps from trusted & known sites/stores like the Google Play Store or Apple App Store.

### Use antivirus software

Keep your devices safe with up-to-date antivirus software. This can help find and stop harmful software like keyloggers.

### Check if a website is legitimate

Before you use a website, check if it's legitimate. Websites like Scam Detector and Scamadviser can give a trust score for websites. You can also check how old the website is. Just search for domain lookup on Google, and you can find sites like whois.com. It shows information about the domain like when it was registered and when it will expire, who registered it, and so on.

If the domain was registered recently, you should think twice before doing anything on the site. Here you can see, the goheard.io domain was registered recently for one year.

## What To Do If You Already Downloaded Goheard

### Disconnect!

Immediately turn off your Wi-Fi and data to prevent the app from sending stolen information.

### Uninstall!

Delete Goheard from your computer.

### Change passwords!

If you think your login details might be stolen, change the passwords for your email, bank accounts, and any other important online services.

### Enable 2-step authentication

Consider enabling two-step authentication (also known as 2FA) for your online accounts. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second verification step (such as a text message or authentication app) in addition to your password.

By doing so, you can better protect your accounts from unauthorized access. Remember to enable 2FA for all relevant services, including email, social media, and financial accounts.
