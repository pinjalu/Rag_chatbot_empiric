## What is Agentic AI?

Unlike traditional AI assistants that provide recommendations, **Agentic AI** acts as an autonomous decision-maker.

It's capable of understanding goals, executing multi-step workflows, and adapting in real time.

In the context of application modernization, Agentic AI can:

- Analyze legacy codebases.
- Identify technical debt.

## Why Application Modernization Matters in 2025

Modern businesses can't afford to be slowed down by legacy systems. Some of the biggest pain points enterprises face include:

- High maintenance costs for outdated infrastructure.
- Scalability issues as customer demand grows.
- Security risks due to unsupported frameworks.
- Compliance pressures (GDPR, HIPAA, ISO).

By **2025**, modernization is no longer optional—it's a **business survival strategy**.

Enterprises are adopting cloud-native, scalable, and AI-ready applications to stay ahead.
