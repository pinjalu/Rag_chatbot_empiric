## Introduction

Buying a property of their own is a dream for many. Finding properties to tick your every requirement box or finding a good seller is difficult. We must admit that traditional methods like billboards, newspaper & magazine ads, and television and radio commercials are quite irrelevant nowadays.

With most individuals now accessing services through their smartphones, real estate mobile app development has become crucial.

According to the National Association of Realtors, about **41% of recent buyers** are taking their first step towards real estate buying or selling by looking online, primarily through their cell phones. This data shows many companies want to focus on mobile app development for real estate businesses.

A recent study also reported that about **61% of real estate business owners** admit that modernization of their core technology can accommodate a more considerable change in their profit margins.

If we go by the above data, there's much work pending for the real estate mobile app development companies.
