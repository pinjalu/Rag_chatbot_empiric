## What Are AI Agents in 2025?

AI agents are **autonomous, AI-powered systems** designed to perform tasks, make decisions, and even collaborate with other software or humans. Unlike simple chatbots of the past, modern AI agents can:

- Understand natural language queries
- Integrate with enterprise systems (CRM, ERP, HR tools)
- Automate workflows across multiple departments
- Learn from data and improve over time

**Examples of AI agents in action include:**

- Virtual assistants handling customer support
- Finance bots managing invoices, compliance, and reporting
- Workflow agents integrating multiple SaaS tools to reduce manual work

This evolution means enterprises no longer need large teams for repetitive tasks - AI agents can handle them efficiently and affordably.
