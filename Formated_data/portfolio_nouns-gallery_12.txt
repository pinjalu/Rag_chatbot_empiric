Generating and managing traits and NFTs posed a primary challenge during Nouns Gallery's development.

### Real-Time NFT Trait Integration

Integrating real-time NFT traits from sources around the world was a complex task.

### Data Security

Ensuring the security of the data, especially given the sensitive nature of NFTs, was a critical concern.

### User-Friendly Experience

Delivering a user-friendly experience to a large user base was a significant challenge.

### NFT Generation from Traits

The process of generating NFTs from the submitted traits using base traits needed to be implemented effectively.

### Random NFT generation

Nouns Gallery generates stunning NFTs from the base traits for community members to publish their traits in the gallery. Community members can also edit their traits.

### Community-driven traits

This is the most important part of the community since the NFT traits are made by a lot of individuals around the world. So making sure that they can interact with the site without any problem was one of the important things to keep in mind.
